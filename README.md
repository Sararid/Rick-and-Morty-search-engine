<h1> PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h1>

<h1 >Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sara</h1>

<h3 >A passionate front-end developer student from Barcelona! Welcome to my Git.âœ¨</h3>

Please find here my first completed App built with REACT: https://sararid.github.io/Rick-and-Morty-search-engine/ !

# Rick and Morty search engine

Welcome to Rick and Morty search Engine App. The application consists of a header, a form with one search input by name and a select option by species. When opening the app, a listing
of characters corresponding to the first page of the API will appear (Please find here the Api documentation: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation).

## Features

1. I use the Rick and Morty Api to fetch and show in the app a list of characters (sorted by name).

2. The user can look for any character by name using the input search or select a specie option from the select input in order to get a complete list of that specif specie.

3. When the user click on any of the characters' card, it takes us to a new page where the user can find more information about that specific character and a button to return to the main page.

4. when the user refresh the page, he/she/they will receive the same info, he/she/they were previously checking (if it is a character card for example, or a list of specific selected specie).

5. If the user is browsing an incorrect link or cannot find a character, there will be an automatic error message with an option to go back to the main page.
